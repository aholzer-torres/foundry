# What & Why
In our home game we have a custom crit rule. We were eternally frustrated when we actually got around to hitting with a critical hit, and then the damage being lower than a normal hit would be. So we decided we would take the max of the damage a normal hit would make from the variable elements, and then roll a normal hit.  

# How
I created this macro to give a new modal allowing the user to do what they need

* select dice that will count as "crit" dice, that will be maxed and rolled
* add or not the appropriate stat modifier to the damage
* have non critical dice in case there are some dice that don't get included in the crit

TODO
* Allow the modal to detect an item or spell from inventory to derive the dice from

# How to install
TODO -- package as an actual module ?
